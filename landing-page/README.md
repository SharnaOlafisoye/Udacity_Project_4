## Instructions

The starter project has some _HTML_ and _CSS_ styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the _HTML_ and _CSS_ files, but primarily the _JavaScript_ file.

The purpose of this page is to show the creation of a landing page by manipulating the DOM.
This landing page allows you to create a landing page that is both responsive on various screens and allows the user to identify each section of the landing page while scrolling the page. 

# Dependencies:
Running this code will require a code editor of your choice and the latest version of node js

# Usage:
In creating the navigation bar dynamically users must be aware that the element must match exactly with the id in the HTML for the landing page to execute correctly.



# Resources: 

Udacity Project 4 walk-thru as a reference guide in building this landing page and looked at stackoverflow and worked in a Study session with Sharynne and Peter
