## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

The purpose of this page is to show the creation of a landing page by manipulating the DOM.


Resources: Udacity Project 4 walk-thru as a reference guide in building this landing page and looked at stackoverflow and worked in a Study session with Sharynne and Peter 

I think that when recieving assistance from the session lead some of my code may have been copied by some other classmates.
